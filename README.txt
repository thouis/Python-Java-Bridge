This is a python wrapper for the Java Native Interface.  It was
written as part of the CellProfiler project (http://cellprofiler.org)
by members of the Imaging Platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and
Harvard.

This code should be considered pre-Alpha quality.  It has been in use
in the CellProfiler project, but may take some time to stabilize as a
standalone library.

Cython is used to compile and link the JNI.
